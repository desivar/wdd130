    <h2>A New Hobby</h2>
    <p> While in the pandemic time, a friend bring me an old Galaxy tab 4 with a stylus. I started to draw with zero experience
      I choose to draw about the Scriptures to bring a light of hope to my friends and relatives. At first, my drawings were naive
    but all of them with a special purpose. Thanks to that gift I developed a new talent, I learned how to edit using Canva, and 
    create messages for the Relief Society, and I even make new Instagram friends. Now I am here learning how to create web pages 
     to put in one site my Scriptures Journaling   </p>
