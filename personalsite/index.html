  <h2>How I started to do Scripture Journalign?</h2>
    <p> While in the middle of the pandemic time, a friend sended me an old
      Galaxy Tab S 4 with an stylus, then my husband added this is for you, and 
      theres a place to draw, I know you will find something usefull to do,after that
      I started to think and I just decided to ilustrate the Scriptures and quotes from
      the prophets. By that time I was a Relief Society Secretary, so I started  to learn how 
      to digital drawing with a program that allows to make drawings with tools similar to 
      when you use a fisical brush and later I learned how to edit using Canvas, and drop by drop
      I turned that old tablet into my favorite place because I found a way to
      learn and to help the sisters by creating meaninful messages t help hem to found
      hope in the middle of our unusual situation. At first, my drawings were like the ones
      making by a kid , but drop by drop I improve and everybody like my ilustrations. Last year,
      I receive as a gift a scriptures journal edition and I started to ilustrate 
      my Scriptures along with "Come Follow me", and  now I am creating this site 
      to share my love for the Scriptures and to keep my ilustrations in one site.
